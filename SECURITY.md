# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Use one of the private channels instead:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory (preferred).**
   [Open a private advisory](https://github.com/synheart-ai/syni-swift/security/advisories/new).
   This creates a private thread visible only to you and the Synheart maintainers.

2. **Email.** Send details to `security@synheart.ai`. Encrypt sensitive content
   if possible.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof-of-concept.
- Affected versions, if known.
- Your contact information for follow-up.

## What to expect

- We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days**.
- We will keep you informed as we investigate and develop a fix.
- We will coordinate disclosure with you. Please do not publish details until
  a fix is released.
- We credit reporters in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

This policy covers the `Syni` SwiftPM package published from this
repository, including its on-device inference bridge, agent layer, and
cloud client. Issues in unrelated dependencies should be reported upstream
to their maintainers.

## Out of scope

- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to an unlocked device.
- Reports generated solely from automated scanners without a working
  proof-of-concept.
- Issues in example/demo code clearly marked as non-production.
- Model outputs (hallucinations, jailbreaks, prompt-injection in user content).
  For persona-spec or safety-rail bypasses, please email security@synheart.ai
  with the persona id and reproducer (the spec itself is maintained
  separately from this SDK).
